# AutoMessage
AutoMessage is a plugin which sends messages that are customizable in the `config.yml` file. You can also customize the delay (in seconds) between those messages.

Now every time that message is sent, a player will hear a sound that is also configurable in the config.yml file.

There is only one command with this command which is `/automessage` it reloads the config of the plugin which is really usefull so you don't need to restart your entire server.

That message needs to have an permission, which it of course does. The permission to use that command is `automsg.admin`.
