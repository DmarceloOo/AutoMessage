# AutoMessage
AutoMessage is a plugin which sends messages that are customizable in the `config.yml` file. You can also customize the delay (in seconds) between those messages.

Now every time that message is sent, a player will hear a sound that is also configurable in the config.yml file.

There is only one command in this plugin. It is called `/automessage`. The command in it's self has 3 different options. Either to turn broadcasting `on/off or reload` the plugin's config.

That message needs to have an permission, which it of course does. The permission to use that command is `automsg.admin`.
